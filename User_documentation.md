## - Modes
There are three modes which the program can be in. They can be switch via the three radio buttons in the top-left corner.
- Add points mode - lets you add new at the location you clicked.
- Delete points mode - removes a point you cliked.
- Move points mode - lets you pick up and move points.

The spline function is redrawn automatically whenever anything changes.


## Adding new points 
New points can be added either by right-clicking or by selecting the 'Add points' mode and left-clicking. The point will appear at the location you clicked.

## Deleting existing points
Existing points can be removed by selecting the 'Delete points' mode and left-clicking on them.

## Moving points
Points can be picked up and dragged by selecting the 'Move points' mode and using the left mouse button.

## Movement in the figure
The graph can be moved by left-clicking and dragging. This doesn't work when in the 'Add points' mode because a new point will be added instead. You can also zoom.

## Changing the limits of the coordinate axis 
If the graph does not fit on the screen, the axis limits can be adjusted so that it does by clicling the 'Fit to screen' button
